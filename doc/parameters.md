## Sticking

| Parameter name | Abbreviation | Description |
|--------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Definition of sticky surface | Surface / Quencher | The radio button defines which part of the protein is "sticky". If the option Surface is chosen, the entire protein surface is sticky, meaning slows down the diffusion of the dye. If quencher is selected, only quenching amino acids slow down the dye's diffusion. |
| Dye surface interaction radius | Rs [A] | Dyes which are closer by a distance R to an atom than the distance "Rs" diffuse slower by the factor "slow factor". Here, the distance R is the distance between the center of the dye and the center of the atom. |
| Factor by which an dye close to the surface is slowed down | slow factor | The diffusion coefficient of the dye is multiplied by this factor if the dye is in vicinity of the protein's surface |
