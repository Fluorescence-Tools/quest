| Parameter name | Abbreviation | Description |
|--------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Definition of sticky surface | Surface / Quencher | The radio button defines which part of the protein is "sticky". If the option Surface is chosen, the entire protein surface is sticky, meaning slows down the diffusion of the dye. If quencher is selected, only quenching amino acids slow down the dye's diffusion. |
| Dye surface interaction radius | Rs [A] | Dyes which are closer by a distance R to an atom than the distance "Rs" diffuse slower by the factor "slow factor". Here, the distance R is the distance between the center of the dye and the center of the atom. |

## Label

| Parameter name | Abbreviation | Description |
|------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chain ID to which the dye is attached to | Chain | The attachment position of the dye linker is selected first by the chain ID |
| The resiude ID of attachment | Residue | The residue ID defines to which residue the dye is attached to |
| The name of the atom of attachment | Atom | The atom name within a residue selects the atom to which the dye is attached to. |
| Linker length of the dye | Length | The linker length is the maximum distance from the attachment point of the dye to the center of the fluorophore |
| Linker width of the dye linker | Width | The width of the linker connecting the dye to the attachment atom position |
| Dye radius | Radius | The dye is approximated by a single sphere with a radius specified by this parameter |
| Simulation grid resolution | dg | The dye diffuses on a grid with a resolution defined by this parameter. |
